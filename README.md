# Encoding-Medical-Data
The primary goal of the proposed research is to enhance the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) for encapsulating medical images using the Watermarking Algorithm.  Image encapsulation is the process of encoding a secret image into some other image's pixel values without appreciably lowering the image's quality. All codes are executed using google colab.
